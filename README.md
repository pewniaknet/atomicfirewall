# perfectfirewall
Small, easy to understand in seconds set of iptables commands for typically internet web server.

At my work I've seen public servers without firewall. Mostly because there is nobody to take care about proper administration.
Developers just want their application to work and firewall is just disturbing thing. The problem is when the site is down, because of 1000/second wp-login requests ;)
